They have been together since they first formed the band as friends back in 2008 jamming their instruments in school. Their lives and shared passion for music eventually turned their jamming sessions to serious practice sessions and it didn‚Äôt take long for them to realize that music was right at the top of the few things that truly made them happy.\n\nMusic has never been just a career path for them, it‚Äôs always been their lifestyle. They are known for a musical style that combines elements of Pop, Classics, Rock n Roll, Soul, Funk, Classic Rock, RnB, Reggae, Country, Rhumba Flamenco, Blues and Jazz.
